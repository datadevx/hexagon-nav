# Hexagon Nav

Style and script to decorate an HTML navigation list as a hexagonal user interface.

## Usage

The main decorator is the `hexagon-nav` class which should be added to the navigation `ul` element. 
Then within your navigation links, wrap the link text in an `h1` tag and optionally include an `img` to specify the background image for that link.
